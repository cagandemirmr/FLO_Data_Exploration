   - The date when the customer made their most recent online order.

7. **Last_order_date_offline**: 
   - The date when the customer made their most recent offline (in-store) order.

8. **Order_num_total_ever_offline**: 
   - The total number of orders placed by the customer through offline channels.

9. **Order_num_total_ever_online**: 
   - The total number of orders placed by the customer through online channels.

10. **Customer_value_total_ever_offline**: 
    - The total revenue generated by the customer from offline purchases.

11. **Customer_value_total_ever_online**: 
    - The total revenue generated by the customer from online purchases.

12. **Interested_in_categories_12**: 
    - This column contains 32 unique values representing categories assigned based on the customer's interests.

13. **Store_type**: 
    - Consists of 3 main store types, with 4 combinations based on customer purchasing habits.

## Steps

### Data Preparation

Before importing the data into SQL, I made several adjustments in Excel:
- Formatted date columns to ensure consistency.
- Removed unnecessary characters and cleaned up the data.

After these modifications, I copied the Excel tables into SQL. This approach is efficient for:
- Familiarizing myself with the data.
- Data normalization, which reduces the size of the data.

However, while this method improves efficiency for checking and exploring data, it's less efficient in terms of large-scale data usage. Fortunately, the dataset's size can be classified as moderate.

### SQL Queries

To gain a basic understanding of the data, I wrote the following queries in SQL:

```sql
-- General overview of the dataset
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- To observe the minimum and maximum character lengths of Master_ID
SELECT DISTINCT MIN(LEN(Master_ID)) AS MINIMUM_LENGTH, 
                MAX(LEN(Master_ID)) AS MAXIMUM_LENGTH 
FROM CUSTOMERS 
GROUP BY Master_ID;

-- Distinct values of the Order Channel
SELECT DISTINCT Order_channel FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Distinct values of the Last Order Channel
SELECT DISTINCT Last_order_channel FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum Last Order Dates
SELECT MIN(Last_order_date) AS MIN_LAST_DATE, 
       MAX(Last_order_date) AS MAX_LAST_DATE 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum First Order Dates
SELECT MIN(First_order_date) AS MIN_FIRST_DATE, 
       MAX(First_order_date) AS MAX_FIRST_DATE 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum Last Online Order Dates
SELECT MIN(Last_order_date_online) AS MIN_LAST_OR_ONLINE_DATE, 
       MAX(Last_order_date_online) AS MAX_LAST_OR_ONLINE_DATE 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum Last Offline Order Dates
SELECT MIN(Last_order_date_offline) AS MIN_LAST_OR_OFFLINE_DATE, 
       MAX(Last_order_date_offline) AS MAX_LAST_OR_OFFLINE_DATE 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum order amounts (offline)
SELECT MIN(Order_num_total_ever_offline), 
       MAX(Order_num_total_ever_offline) 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum order amounts (online)
SELECT MIN(Order_num_total_ever_online), 
       MAX(Order_num_total_ever_online) 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum customer values (offline)
SELECT MIN(Customer_value_total_ever_offline), 
       MAX(Customer_value_total_ever_offline) 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Minimum and maximum customer values (online)
SELECT MIN(Customer_value_total_ever_online), 
       MAX(Customer_value_total_ever_online) 
FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Distinct values of Interested Categories
SELECT DISTINCT Interested_in_categories_12 FROM CUSTOMERS;

-- Distinct values of Store Type
SELECT DISTINCT Store_type FROM CUSTOMERS;

```
These queries provided a foundational understanding of the data and helped identify key trends and outliers in customer behavior, order channels, and purchasing patterns

### Analysis Questions

In the end of variability analysis,some questions appeared in my mind and write querries in SQL.

1. **What is the unique customer number who made a purchase?**

  select count(distinct Master_ID) TOTALCUSTOMERS from CUSTOMERS .
